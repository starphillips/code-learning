Closure is a function that captures variables 

"remembers" variables from the scope it was created in, even after that scope has exited.

Where the inner function keeps reference to variables in the outer function

``` go
package main

import "fmt"

func adder() func(int) int {
	sum := 0
	return func(x int) int {  // Here the returned function is a closure that uses and updates that sum
		sum += x // Whilst sum is declared in adder it lives on as long as the closure above exists (because closure captures it)
		return sum
	}
}

func main() {
	pos, neg := adder(), adder()
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		fmt.Println(
			pos(i),
			neg(-2*i),
		)
	}
}
```
