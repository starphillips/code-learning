io.Reader is a source of data you can read from 


Reader Interface:

`Read(b []byte) (n int, err error)`
This method fills the byte slice b with data, returns how many bytes it filled (n) and returns an error (err)

``` go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	r := strings.NewReader("Hello, Reader!") // Wants you to read this in

	b := make([]byte, 8) // Creates a byte slice (like an array) that can hold 8 bytes
	for {
		n, err := r.Read(b) // Puts in how many bytes were actually read and put into b and err nil if its all good.
		fmt.Printf("n = %v err = %v b = %v\n", n, err, b) // Format answer
		fmt.Printf("b[:n] = %q\n", b[:n]) // Tells you what is read and formatted for print
		if err == io.EOF { // io.EOF is if there is nothing left, so that when there is nothing it will break out of the reader
			break
		}
	}
}
```
