Range is used to loop over elements in:
-	Slices
-	Arrays
-	Maps
-	Strings
-	Channels

**Range provides index and value** 

Go requires you to use all variables that you declare

To loop over elements:
``` go

var pow = []int{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128}

	for i, v := range pow {
		fmt.Printf("2**%d = %d\n", i, v) 
		// Puts i and v inside its correct placeholders
	}
```

`fmt.Println("2**", i, "=", v)` - Alternative use to get the format, but 1st one is better



**RANGE - with blanks**
Go requires you to use all variables that you declare but blank indicators lets you ignore when its not needed

When you donâ€™t need the index or variable so go lets you assign to the blank identifier - aka ignore this.

Can still use an array, slice but not need both value and index
	
``` go 
pow := make([]int, 10)
for j := range pow {
	pow[j] = 1 << uint(j) // == 2**j
}
for _, value := range pow { // If index is not needed use the _ and visa versa for value
	fmt.Printf("%d\n", value)
}
```
