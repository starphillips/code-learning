Channels are a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values with the channel operator, <- 

(The data flows in the direction of the arrow.)

Channels can be buffered. Provide the buffer length as the second argument to make to initialize a buffered channel:
`ch := make(chan int, 100)`

Sends to a buffered channel block only when the buffer is full. Receives block when the buffer is empty.


``` go
package main

import "fmt"

func sum(s []int, c chan int) { // uses the channel in main as an argument
	sum := 0
	for _, v := range s {
		sum += v
	}
	c <- sum // send sum to c
}

func main() {
	s := []int{7, 2, 8, -9, 4, 0}

	c := make(chan int) // channel created
	go sum(s[:len(s)/2], c)
	go sum(s[len(s)/2:], c)
	x, y := <-c, <-c // receive from c, that was previously sent from sum

	fmt.Println(x, y, x+y)
}

// BUFFERED CHANNELS

// Channels can be buffered. Provide the buffer length as the second argument to make to initialize a buffered channel:

// ch := make(chan int, 100)

// Sends to a buffered channel block only when the buffer is full. Receives block when the buffer is empty.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	ch := make(chan int, 2)
	ch <- 1
	ch <- 2
	ch <- 3
	fmt.Println(<-ch)
	fmt.Println(<-ch)
	fmt.Println(<-ch)
}

```
This would cause a runtime error as wen sending in 3 it is too much

**Range and Close**
A sender can close a channel to indicate that no more values will be sent. 

Receivers can test whether a channel has been closed by assigning a second parameter to the receive expression: after

You don't usually need to close them. Closing is only necessary when the receiver must be told there are no more values coming, such as to terminate a range loop.

Only the sender should close a channel, never the receiver.


``` go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func fibonacci(n int, c chan int) {
	x, y := 0, 1
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ { 
		c <- x
		x, y = y, x+y
	}
	close(c)
}

func main() {
	c := make(chan int, 10)
	go fibonacci(cap(c), c)
	for i := range c { // Receives values until its closed, when i < n
		fmt.Println(i)
	}
}
```
