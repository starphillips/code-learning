-	Always needs `package` 
-	`import` follow after package name
-	Needs a main package (like Java)
-	`const` are declared like variables but cannot be done without `:=`
-	`fmt.Println()` printing
-	`fmt.Sprintf` builds a formatted string and returns it
-	 maps and slices, channels must be created before use


##### Variables:

-	Variables will be declared but anything declared without a value will default to 0, “ “ 
-	You can define variables at the package level (not inside a func) and they initialise before `main()` runs, so will be available to all funcs in the package


Example:
``` go
func main() {

    var y int = 5 // Declare variable like this

    x := 15       // Shortcut to var declaration (ONLY INSIDE A FUNCTION)

    fmt.Println(x + y)
```
