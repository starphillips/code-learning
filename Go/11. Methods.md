Method is a func with a special receiver

Methods are similar to functions but with a key distinction: they have a receiver. 

A receiver is a special argument that allows the method to operate on a specific type (like a struct or any custom type). 

Fundamental part of Go's approach to object-oriented programming.
Key Features of Methods in Go

Receiver Argument: The receiver is specified between the func keyword and the method name. It can be a value receiver or a pointer receiver.

No Classes: Go does not have classes, but methods allow you to associate behavior with types.
Same Package: Methods must be defined in the same package as the type they are associated with.

``` go
Gofunc (receiverType ReceiverName) MethodName(parameters) returnType {
    // Method body
}
```

**Method vs Function:**

Use a method when:
•	The operation logically belongs to the type (e.g., magnitude of a Vertex).
•	You plan to use interfaces.
•	You want cleaner, object-like syntax (v.Abs()).

Use a function when:
•	The operation is generic or doesn’t belong specifically to one type.
•	You’re working with a type you can’t modify.
•	You want to keep business logic separate from data types.

**Syntax Differences**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

// Here we define a struct
type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

// v Vertex means its a method (and in this context of Vertex type)
// where v = receiver, Abs = method name and float64 is return type

// func (receiver and method) Name() returnType{
func (v Vertex) Abs() float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{3, 4}
	fmt.Println(v.Abs())

// You can declare methods on non-struct types too e.g. int, String, float

// type is defined here
type MyFloat float64

// You can only can declare a method with a receiver whose type is defined in the same package
// As seen above


func (f MyFloat) Ab() float64 {

}
}
```

ALSO,  you cannot declare a built in type or a method where reciever type is in another package 

You cannot declare a built-in type or a method where receiver type is in another package

e.g `func (x int)Ab()` would NOT work. You need to define it first e.g. 

``` go
type MyFloat float64
func (f MyFloat) Ab() float64 {}
```
