``` go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func say(s string) {
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
		fmt.Println(s)
	}
}

func main() {
	go say("world")
	say("hello")
}
```

Allows you to run simultaneously
So here it prints hello and world alternating because world says go 
As opposed to running world 5 times then hello 5 times



Example: building a web server. 

Without goroutines:
•	Handle one request at a time.
•	If one user uploads a huge file, everyone else waits. 

With goroutines:
•	Handle each request in its own goroutine.
•	Thousands of users can interact with your server simultaneously
