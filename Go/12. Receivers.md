``` go
type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func (v Vertex) Abs() float64 {
	// Value receiver (v is a copy)
	// Without * it works on a copy and throws away after
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)

	// Using a copy is beneficial as it keeps its original value
	// You can just use the data to work with or simulate without changing
}

func (v *Vertex) Scale(f float64) {
	// Pointer receiver (v points to the original)
	// *Vertex means it will really update the X and Y
	v.X = v.X * f
	v.Y = v.Y * f
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{3, 4}
	v.Scale(10)
	fmt.Println(v.Abs()) // Expect 50
}
```

**Pointer Receiver vs value Receiver**

Pointer receiver:

``` go
func (v *Vertex) Scale(f float64) {
	v.X *= f
	v.Y *= f
}
```
This will point to the original, the user can then adapt the original

Value receiver:
``` go
func (v Vertex) Abs() float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}
```
This will provide a copy, so that the user can use the data to potentially compute something else without changing the original.

**Correct Syntax for Function vs Method with pointer receiver**

![[function-syntax.png]]

Functions with a pointer argument must take a pointer.
Functions that take a value argument must take a value of that specific type.

Methods with pointer receivers can take either a value or pointer as the receiver.
Methods with value receivers take either a value or a pointer as the receiver.


**Choosing a pointer receiver:**

Pointer receiver if you want to change the original value.
Can modify the value that its receiver points to.
