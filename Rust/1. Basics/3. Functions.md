the main function, which is the entry point of many programs. 

We define a function in Rust by entering fn followed by a function name and a set of parentheses. The curly brackets tell the compiler where the function body begins and ends.
``` rust 
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    another_function();
}

fn my_function() {
	println!("Another function")
}
```


SNAKE CASE 

`lowercase_and_underscores_for_spaces` (hopefully not that long)

Parameters in a function
``` rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```


``` rust
fn main() {
	let sum = my_function(11, 16)}

fn my_function(x: int32, y: int32) -> int32 {
	println!("The value of x is {}", x)
	println!("The value of y is {}", y)
	x + y
}
```
