#### Tuples
Can define, supply types and assign in one row one like so
``` rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```

Can define vars based on the arguments inside the tuple
``` rust
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```

Can reach any index of a tuple via `.0` notation
``` rust
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
```

#### Arrays

Arrays are fixed length
Defined by [ ]
Every value in an array must have the same type
Can get specific values in an array like `array[0]`

`let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];` arrays can be defined like this. 
[Declare type, the number of values] = [what the values are]

`let b [0; 8]`; or like this (8 values all set to 0 0)
