const vs variable

vars are mutable with the `let mut`
var types do not have to be stated
var can change types when redeclaring e.g.
```rust
let x = 5 // int
println!(x)
let x = "six" // string
println!(x)
```
const types my be stated e.g. `const count: u32 = 100000;`



Printing vars
```rust
let x = 6
println!("The value of x is {}", x)
```
