1. Integers will do a copy 
EXAMPLE: y will be a copy of x (y=5)

2. The string types will do a clone()

This takes up more data.

EXAMPLE:
Here the attempt to print is after it has moved to `takes_ownership`.
This causes s to error at print because the s has now moved to the value `some_string`. 
Once its moved it cannot be used to print by using the var name 's'

After the scope is done, the `some_string` variable is dropped.


3. Here x is allowed to be printed in main. This is because x is an integer. 

So it is copied and therefore can be used after it is copied.

Here in the `gives_ownership` function, we are returning the variable `some_string`, so it can be used. 

This is because returning gives the ownership to the `s1` variable so now it can be used.

We don't need the return keyword.



You can move ownership out of a func into a var to put back into a func but that is tedious.

This is where referencing comes in.
