During runtime, Rust makes decisions about memory depending on where its stored - the stack or the heap. 

During runtime, the application has access to both the stack and the heap.

##### Stack
The stack is **fixed.** It cannot grow or shrink during runtime.

The stack stores stack frames
Stack frames are created for every function that executes.
Stack stores the local variables of the function being executed.

The size of a stack frame is complied at runtime, so variables inside a stack frames must be fixed in size.

Variables inside the function only live as long as the stack frame lives

##### Heap
The heap can grow or shrink at runtime. 
Data stored in the heap can be dynamic in size 
We control the lifetime of the data (unlike data stored in stacks that only live as long as stack frame lives)

##### Differences 

- Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating to the heap
	(because the heap has to spend time looking for a place to store the new data.)

- Accessing data on the stack is faster than accessing data on the heap 
	(because with the heap you have to follow the pointer.)

- The pointer will be stored in the stack
	where that pointer leads to will be stored on the heap
