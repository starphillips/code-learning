Define struct with its types, like Go
``` rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}
```

Use it like so:
``` rust
fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}
```

If mutable, the entire instance must be mutable.
``` rust
fn main() {
    let mut user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };

    user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com"); // if mutable we can change the variable value
}
```
To get a specific value from a struct, we use dot notation. 

For example, to access this user’s email address, we use user1.email. If the instance is mutable, we can change a value by using the dot notation and assigning into a particular field.
