Tuple
``` rust
fn main() {
    let rect1 = (30, 50);

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        area(rect1)
    );
}

fn area(dimensions: (u32, u32)) -> u32 {
    dimensions.0 * dimensions.1
}
```

Struct
``` rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        area(&rect1)
    );
}

fn area(rectangle: &Rectangle) -> u32 {
    rectangle.width * rectangle.height
}
```

Whilst the tuple works well, it is less reusable?
You're defining your rect1 and dimensions func takes the 1st and 2nd params of the tuple.

With the struct, it is more labelled and can be clearer.
We define what a rectangle is with a struct
We can create an instance of rectangle
We can get the area to base it on the params of the struct, not on indexes of a tuple
